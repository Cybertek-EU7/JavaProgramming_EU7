Data very important part of Tester's work life
Data---> BackEnd (Database+API) + FrontEnd (WebBrowsers)

3 Data Structures that comes with JAVA:
	Arrays (primitive data type+non-primitive(objects))
	Collections---ArrayList, List, Set, Vector....
	Maps (non-primitive , key-value)
	
Array: 	part of the Data Structure
		fixed size
		support primitive(int,double,char...) + non-primitive(Integer, Double, Character,String)
		ordered (it has index)
		can be multi-dimensional

single dimensional arrays : to store elements

multi-dimesional arrays : to store arrays
	
		N dimensional array contains (N-1) dimensional array
			
				2D array : contains 1D arrays
				arr2D = {{1,2,3},{4,5,6},{7,8,9}}
				reach an element  [index of 1D array][index of element]--> 8: [2][1]
				
				3D array: contains 2D arrays
				arr3D = {
						{{1,2,3},{4,5,6},{7,8,9}} , 
						{{3,4,7},{4,3},{9,4}}  
						}
				[index of 2D array][index of 1D array][index element]........->8:[0][2][1]


ArrayList: 	part of Collection, internally uses Array(keeps creating new Arrays--Slow)
			size is not fixed
			supports only non-primitive  (can hold objects) Can we put our own custom made objects?
			ordered (it has index)
	****   can NOT be multi-dimensional******
			it keeps duplicate values (Set: this one allow duplicate)
	
	ArrayList Methods:
		 * add(value) -> Appends value at end of list
         * 
         * add(index, value) -> Inserts given value just before the given index,
         * shifting subsequent values to the right
         * 
         * clear() -> Removes all elements of the list
         * 
         * indexOf(value) -> Returns first index where given value is found in list
         * 
         * get(index) -> Returns the value at given index
         * 
         * remove(index) -> Removes/Returns value at given index
         * 
         * size() -> Returns the number of elements in list
         * 
         * set(index, value) -> Replaces value at given index with given value
	
	Declare ArrayList
	ArrayList<Integer> nums = new ArrayList<>();
	
	Raw Style : ArrayList list = new ArrayList<>();  you can put any object type Integer, Double, String (NOT RECOMMENDED)
	
	
			

Wrapper Class: the need for this Wrapper class is: Collections and Maps only hold non-primitive
			second: this class come with useful methods.
			turns our primitive data types into objects 
	int ---> Integer
	double -----> Double		
			
			
			

isAnagram Method Algorithm:
1. I have two words, see if they anagram
2. takes each char, and uses it's Decimal value, so I can create an array of integers
3. I have only one int array, for the first word, I want to  add value of '1' to my array
4. For the second word, I want to delete value of '1' from the same array 
5. At the end if my int array stays empty, this means that my words are anagram				
			
Arrays Utility Class
Arrays.toString method : for printing 1D arrays
Arrays.deepToString : for printing 2D arrays
Arrays.equal : for check equality of arrays
Arrays.sort : sorting the Arrays
Arrays.binarySearch
Arrays.copyOf
