static methods:
	Character.isDigit(10)
	can be called using Class Names, it belongs to the class
	can be called using object name

static methods vs instance methods
1) instance methods can be called only using the object name
2) static methods can ONLY reach static variables or methods
instance methods can call both static and instance	
	
	Instance variables or methods: THese belongs to objects created
	
** 3 Friends of Initialization
1) Static initializer block (runs before everything else, only once when class is loaded by ClassLoader)
2) Instance initializer block (runs each time object is created, before constructor)
3) Constructor (initializer block) (runs each time object is created)

Inheritance:
=============
* a class can inherit the properties/behavior of another class
* it is providing us reusability and maintainability
* it is also a good way to organize our code
* we use extends key word

public ChildClass extends ParentClass(){}

Inheritance creates "is A" relationship

"has A" relationship 

*** JAVA does NOT support multiple inheritance, class can extend only one another class
----with abstraction it becomes possible-----
